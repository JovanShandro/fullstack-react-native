# fullstack-react-native
A repo with the codes from the Fullstack React Native book rewritten using typescript.

Here you will find the source code for all the projects developed in the 'Full Stack React Native' book from fullstack.io :book: apart from the last
project involving the creation of a native component.

All components are functional and make use of react hooks.
